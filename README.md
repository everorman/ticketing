Mandatory command to config nginx:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.7.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

command only for gcloud:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.7.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

When you setup nginx in gcloud it configs a load balancer automatically, you can check this in Networks services and see inside of load balancer

npm i cookie-session @types/cookie-session
```
